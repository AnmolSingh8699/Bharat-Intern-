This is my virtual internship of Data Science  by Bharat Intern . 

In this internship I have completed two tasks :
Titanic Survival Count
Image Classification Between dogs and cats 

This internship helps me to gain hands on experience on various python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplot, seaborn, tensorflow. Also, helped me to enhace my data analysis tools by practicing.
